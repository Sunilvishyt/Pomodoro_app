Its my one of the first big projects that I made for my own use. I regularly use the pomodoro technique in my work cycles
so I made the app as my likings and some of its feature are mentioned that I added to improve the user experience like-

1> when the timer changes from work mode to break mode it will play the sound and let you know.

2> break and work has different sounds so you can guess what is the time for what without maximizing the app various time.

3> if you place the app window behind every other window of programs so when the time will change the mode from work to 
break or break to work it will automatically come in front of the every other window that you are working to let you know,
just make sure you don't minimize the window it should be behind the screen.
